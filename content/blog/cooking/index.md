Cooking has become one of my favorite things to do. I am not really sure as to why but it really is a great way to find new things to try and and enjoy.

## A bit of history

I have always loved food and to try the different kinds of cuises that are out there. Good food is just something that I have a passion for. With that comes a lot of cravings and when those hit you can sometimes struggle to be able to find that craving anytime soon. What I did find is that the ingredients for those cravings are a lot easier to find and get your hands on. 

When I first got married I was the go to cook between my wife and myself. One of the things we connected on was our love for good food. So with the knowledge I mentioned above we dove into a large world of recipes and I started cooking all sorts of foods.

## Some of my Favorites

- [Carne Asada](https://damndelicious.net/2019/05/05/carne-asada/)
This is hands down one of my favorite meals to eat! The best part is how many ways you can use the meat. If you want tacos, burritos, or nachos this works perfect and the protien. Its great with some homemade salsa and guacamole!

- [Rack of Lamb](https://houseofnasheats.com/rosemary-garlic-oven-roasted-rack-of-lamb/)
This is a great recipe if you are looking to try lamb for the first time or if you are a long time lover of it. I always feel like I could eat an entire rack of lamb myself. It's also my wifes number one meal, it is a great alternative to holiday meals.
