Working in the development field I have come to learn a couple of important things that every developer should be doing. One of those I want to talk about here and now. That is having a hobby that allows you to get out of your routine and refresh your mind.

## The why behind my thoughts

Being overworked and run down is becoming a common thing on development teams. I have seen a lot of developers get consumed by coding and it becomes all they do. This leads to them not performing as well and getting tierd of the work they are doing. Here is a great list of ways hobbies can help them with this issue:

- Relieves Stress
- Takes you outside your normal routine
- Clears your mind
- Develope new skills

Last year during the summer I was finding myself in this slump and hating my job and not wanting to finish shcool. I knew something was wrong and needed to do something new in my routine. I decided to pick up golfing and from then on I found myself less stressed and more focused on my work. I was able to actually allow my brain to clock out of coding and clock into a new and very different challenge. 

### The Benefits

To name just a couple of the benefits that I found from developing a new hobby, I was able to destress, improve the quality of work I was doing, and my overall mood also improved. When talking with other developers who have done this they all mention the same things. The idea of developing new hobbies is not just needed for developers but for everyone. You should always consider pushing yourself ourside of your comfort zone. Doin this will offer some great benefits. Here are some helpful articles diving deeper on the topic.
